All this is pretty advanced rewriting going on, some of you might like it
( the Apache Foundation complimented me on it, it's all good ;-)

it cuts off the preceding stuff unless it's "mail.", in which case it redirects to the SSL Host.

Make sure you have these two DNS Zone records (A and CNAME records):

 *.yourdomain.net
 mail.yourdomain.net

pointing to your server's public IP (the WAN address).


This setup catches all typos for hostnames and redirects them to the  http://yourdomain.net  host.
Many users will love this, since it pushes all traffic over one ('hostless') name only,
and shortens the URL.


Of course you can add VirtualHosts with other hostnames, as long as you create a separate A record
for each name, plus a separate <VirtualHost> container for each name.







Problem staying logged in? 'You must be logged in' and the likes ?


For the Fedora Core / Apache 2 / https login problem relating to Mozilla Firefox, try this:
( firefox was actually correct in showing this problem, since the server setup wasn't safe )

- Disable the Sq.M. https redirect plugin (Apache 2 takes care of that
when you have your mail done in a separate https Virtual Host container)


- Make sure a  /usr/share/squirrelmail/favicon.ico  exists!
( thanks to Bill Polhemus for confirming this )


- Make sure the directory where php stores its sessions is readable/writeable by the web server user;
That is to say, the directory configured in php.ini:
session.save_path = /var/lib/php/session
needs permissions 40770 (Octal) and user:group "root:apache" in case of Fedora Core.

- Make sure the directory /var/lib/squirrelmail/prefs
has permissions 40700 (Octal) and user of your httpd (usually "apache").
